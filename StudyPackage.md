Absolutely! Let’s outline a **minimal React learning program** — designed so you can gradually build up your skills from scratch. I’ll include **core topics, mini-projects, and resources**, keeping it very practical.

---

## **Phase 1: React Basics**

**Goal:** Understand components, JSX, props, and state.

### Topics to learn:

1. **JSX** – how to write HTML inside JS
2. **Components**

   * Functional components
   * Props
   * Default props
3. **State**

   * `useState` hook
   * Updating and reading state
4. **Events**

   * `onClick`, `onChange`, `onSubmit`

### Mini-projects:

* **Counter app**

  * Button to increment/decrement a number
* **Todo list**

  * Add/remove tasks using `useState`

### Resources:

* React official docs: [Main Concepts](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
* FreeCodeCamp React tutorials

---

## **Phase 2: React Hooks**

**Goal:** Manage side effects and context in React.

### Topics:

1. `useEffect` – fetching data, lifecycle equivalents
2. `useContext` – sharing data globally
3. `useRef` – references to DOM elements
4. `useReducer` – complex state management

### Mini-projects:

* **Movie list app**

  * Fetch data from a public API (like TMDB)
  * Display results
* **Theme switcher**

  * Light/dark mode using `useContext`

---

## **Phase 3: React Router & Navigation**

**Goal:** Build multi-page apps.

### Topics:

1. `react-router-dom` basics
2. `Routes` and `Route`
3. Navigation with `Link`
4. Redirects and `Navigate`
5. Route parameters

### Mini-projects:

* **Multi-page app**

  * Home, About, Contact pages
* **Movie app**

  * Home page, Favorites page
  * Clicking a movie shows details on a separate page

---

## **Phase 4: Working with APIs**

**Goal:** Handle real data and errors.

### Topics:

1. Fetching with `fetch` or `axios`
2. Loading and error states
3. Handling empty or invalid data

### Mini-projects:

* **Weather app**

  * Input a city, fetch weather from API
* **Movie app**

  * Search movies from TMDB (like your current project)
  * Handle empty results safely

---

## **Phase 5: Advanced React**

**Goal:** Make apps robust and scalable.

### Topics:

1. Performance optimizations

   * `React.memo`
   * `useCallback` / `useMemo`
2. Form handling

   * Controlled vs uncontrolled components
3. Custom hooks
4. Component libraries (optional)

   * Material-UI, TailwindCSS, Bootstrap
5. Context + Reducer for complex global state

### Mini-projects:

* **Todo app with local storage**
* **Movie app with favorites stored in context**
* **Search app with paginated results**

---

## **Phase 6: Build a Real Project**

Pick one project to **combine all skills**:

* **Movie App**

  * Home page: popular movies
  * Search page: search movies
  * Favorites page: saved movies using context
  * Error/loading states
  * Routing and navigation
* Optional: deploy using **Vercel** or **Netlify**

---

### Tips for learning

* **Start small:** Build small components first.
* **Read errors carefully:** React’s error messages usually tell you exactly what’s wrong.
* **Practice daily:** Even a small app per day helps a lot.
* **Use console.log** to debug state and props.

---

If you want, I can **write a 1-week React learning roadmap with exact exercises**, so you can follow it day by day — it’s super practical for beginners.

Do you want me to do that?
